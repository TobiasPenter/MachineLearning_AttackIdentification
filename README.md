# Levaraging Machine Learning to Identify Types of Attacks witin in a Network

## About this Project
The aim of this project is to create a machine learning model that will be capable of identifying what type of attack/attacks are present within a pcap file that has been entered into the software. If this research project is successful, I hope that this approach can be addapted to live network traffic streams and help greatly with keeping a network secure for a SOC (Security Opperation Center) team as well as giving insight into the attacks on a network for a CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) team.
